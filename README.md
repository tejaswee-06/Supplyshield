# 🚨 The Problem

Supply-chain disruptions rarely affect only one operational component.

A delayed shipment can simultaneously create:

- 📦 Inventory shortages
- 🏭 Production risk
- 🚚 Logistics constraints
- 🏢 Supplier dependency
- 💰 Financial exposure
- ⚠️ Operational risk
- 🛒 Emergency procurement requirements

Traditional workflows require teams to manually connect these signals across inventory, logistics, suppliers, finance, procurement and risk systems.

This creates three critical problems:

| Problem | Impact |
|---|---|
| Fragmented information | Teams operate on disconnected signals |
| Slow decision-making | Recovery actions take too long |
| Unverified AI recommendations | Incorrect or unauthorized actions can create additional risk |

SupplyShield converts this fragmented process into a **coordinated, observable and policy-governed recovery workflow**.

---

# 💡 The Solution

**SupplyShield** is an AI-powered multi-agent supply-chain resilience platform that investigates disruptions, evaluates downstream impact, identifies recovery options, validates them against deterministic policies, and produces a structured recovery plan.

Instead of asking one general-purpose AI agent to solve the entire problem, SupplyShield decomposes the incident across specialized agents.

```

---

# 🧠 Core Principle

> **LLMs reason. Deterministic tools verify. Policies govern. Humans remain in control.**

SupplyShield deliberately separates AI reasoning from operational truth.

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| 🤖 AI Agents | Reasoning, coordination and synthesis |
| 🧮 Deterministic Tools | Calculations and source-of-truth operations |
| 🛡️ Security Engine | Authorization and policy enforcement |
| 📊 Control Room | Visualization and operational awareness |
| 🔍 Audit Layer | Traceability and observability |
| 👤 Human Operators | Oversight and authorization |

This architecture prevents the system from treating an LLM-generated response as an automatically executable business decision.

---

# 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

SupplyChain recovery is inherently multi-dimensional.

SupplyShield therefore assigns dedicated responsibilities to specialized agents.

| Agent | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| 📦 **Inventory Agent** | Calculates inventory position, runway and shortage exposure |
| 🚢 **Shipment Agent** | Investigates delayed shipments and shipment-level risk |
| 🏭 **Supplier Agent** | Identifies supplier alternatives and supplier constraints |
| 🚚 **Logistics Agent** | Evaluates routes, capacity and expedited transportation |
| 💰 **Finance Agent** | Validates financial constraints and recovery economics |
| ⚠️ **Risk Agent** | Aggregates operational risk across the incident |
| 🛒 **Procurement Agent** | Generates emergency procurement proposals |
| 🎯 **Command Agent** | Coordinates findings and synthesizes the final recovery plan |

Each agent operates within a defined responsibility boundary.

# 🔥 Real Recovery Orchestration

SupplyShield does **not** assume that a delayed shipment automatically requires emergency procurement.

For the supplied incident:

### `SHP001`

- Shipment delay: approximately **6 days**
- Available inventory runway: approximately **3.31 days**

The recovery engine evaluates whether the existing delayed shipment can first be used to bridge the runway through an expedited route.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    A["🚨 Incident: SHP001"] --> B["📦 Calculate Inventory Runway"]

    B --> C["⏱️ ~3.31 Days Available"]
    C --> D["🚢 Shipment Delay: ~6 Days"]

    D --> E{"Can delayed shipment<br/>be partially expedited?"}

    E -->|YES| F["🚚 Find Origin-Compatible Route"]

    F --> G{"Sufficient Capacity<br/>and Policy Compliant?"}

    G -->|YES| H["⚡ Expedite Required Quantity"]
    H --> I["✅ Recovery Plan"]

    G -->|NO| J["🛒 Emergency Procurement"]

    E -->|NO| J

    J --> K{"Supplier + Finance +<br/>Policy Validation"}

    K -->|YES| I
    K -->|NO| L["🚫 NO_FEASIBLE_PLAN"]
```

### Recovery priority

The system evaluates:

1. **Existing delayed shipment**
2. **Expedited route feasibility**
3. **Route capacity**
4. **Origin compatibility**
5. **Policy compliance**
6. **Emergency procurement fallback**
7. **Supplier and financial constraints**
8. **Final recovery feasibility**

If no compliant recovery path exists, SupplyShield returns:

```text
NO_FEASIBLE_PLAN
```

It does **not fabricate a successful recovery** simply to produce a positive dashboard result.

---

# 🔐 Security-First Architecture

Agentic systems should not have unrestricted access to sensitive operational actions.

SupplyShield therefore places a deterministic security engine **before execution**.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    A["🤖 Agent Action Request"] --> B["🔐 Security Engine"]

    B --> C["Identity / Agent Validation"]
    C --> D["Permission Check"]
    D --> E["Policy Evaluation"]
    E --> F["Input Validation"]
    F --> G["Action Constraints"]

    G --> H{"Authorized?"}

    H -->|YES| I["⚙️ Execute Tool"]
    H -->|NO| J["🚫 Block Action"]

    I --> K["📝 Audit Event"]
    J --> K

    L["📨 Untrusted Supplier Message"] --> B
    L -.->|"Cannot grant permissions"| J
```

Security policies are centralized in:

```text
data/policies.json
```

External supplier messages are treated as **untrusted data**.

They cannot:

- Grant themselves permissions
- Override security policies
- Execute privileged tools
- Modify authorization rules
- Bypass the security engine

---

# 🧪 Malicious Supplier Demonstration

SupplyShield includes a dedicated security demonstration showing how an untrusted supplier instruction is handled.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    A["📨 Supplier Message"] --> B["⚠️ Untrusted Input"]

    B --> C["🔐 Security Engine"]

    C --> D["Permission Check"]
    D --> E["Policy Evaluation"]

    E --> F{"Privileged Action<br/>Allowed?"}

    F -->|YES| G["⚙️ Tool Executor"]
    F -->|NO| H["🚫 BLOCKED"]

    H --> I["📝 Security Audit Event"]

    G --> J["📝 Execution Audit Event"]

    K["❌ Supplier cannot<br/>grant permissions"] -.-> H
```

The important property is that the request is stopped **before the privileged executor is reached** when the policy does not permit it.

---

# 📊 Control Room

The React dashboard acts as the operational command center.

### Dashboard visibility

- 🚨 Active disruptions
- 📦 Inventory runway
- 🚢 Delayed shipments
- 🏭 Supplier status
- 🚚 Route options
- 💰 Financial constraints
- 🤖 Agent activity
- ⚠️ Risk indicators
- 🔐 Security events
- 🔄 Recovery timeline
- 📋 Procurement proposals

### Dynamic Recovery Timeline

The recovery timeline is populated from the **actual backend workflow**.

It is not a hardcoded frontend animation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

    A["🚨 Incident<br/>Detected"]
    B["🚢 Shipment<br/>Investigated"]
    C["📦 Inventory<br/>Risk"]
    D["🚚 Routes<br/>Evaluated"]
    E["🏭 Suppliers<br/>Checked"]
    F["💰 Finance<br/>Validated"]
    G["🧠 Recovery<br/>Generated"]
    H["🛡️ Security<br/>Gate"]
    I["✅ Final<br/>Recovery State"]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H --> I
```

---

# 🧮 Why Deterministic Tools Matter

SupplyShield deliberately avoids letting the LLM invent operational facts.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

    A["🧠 Agent Reasoning"] --> B["🔧 Deterministic Tool"]

    B --> C["📊 Source Data"]

    C --> D["🧮 Verified Calculation"]

    D --> E["🔎 Agent Interpretation"]

    E --> F["🛡️ Policy Validation"]

    F --> G["📋 Recovery Decision"]
```

This creates a separation between:

**Reasoning → Verification → Governance → Decision**

rather than:

**Prompt → LLM → Action**

# 📡 Recovery API

### Standard recovery request

```json
{
  "shipment_id": "SHP001"
}
```

### Replan while excluding a disrupted supplier

```json
{
  "shipment_id": "SHP001",
  "exclude_supplier_ids": [
    "SUP002"
  ]
}
```

The backend performs the actual orchestration and returns a structured recovery result to the frontend.

---

# 🧠 Design Principles

### 01 — Deterministic Truth

LLMs are used for reasoning and orchestration.

Critical calculations remain grounded in deterministic tools and source data.

### 02 — No Fabricated Success

If a compliant recovery strategy cannot be found:

```text
NO_FEASIBLE_PLAN
```

is returned.

### 03 — Least Privilege

Agents receive only the capabilities required for their responsibilities.

### 04 — Untrusted Inputs Stay Untrusted

External supplier messages cannot elevate their own permissions.

### 05 — Observable Autonomy

Agent activity and security events are visible and auditable.

### 06 — Human Authorization

The current procurement and shipment tools generate proposals rather than silently modifying external ERP systems.

---

# 🌐 Extensible Enterprise Architecture

SupplyShield uses a replaceable data and tool layer.

The current implementation uses CSV/JSON-backed deterministic tools, while the architecture can evolve toward enterprise systems.

```mermaid
flowchart TB

    A["🧮 Deterministic Tool Interface"]

    A --> B["CSV / JSON"]
    A --> C["PostgreSQL"]
    A --> D["Firestore"]
    A --> E["ERP"]
    A --> F["WMS"]
    A --> G["TMS"]

    B --> H["🛡️ SupplyShield"]
    C --> H
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I["🤖 Agent Layer"]
    H --> J["🔐 Policy Engine"]
    H --> K["📊 Control Room"]

    I --> L["📋 Recovery Proposal"]
    J --> L
    K --> L
```

This allows the agent layer to evolve without requiring a complete rewrite of the decision architecture.

---

# 🏆 Why SupplyShield?

SupplyShield is built around a fundamental distinction:

> **An AI system should not simply generate an answer. It should investigate, verify, respect constraints, explain its decision, and fail safely when no valid answer exists.**

That is why SupplyShield combines:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

    A["🧠 AI Reasoning"] --> F["🛡️ Trustworthy Recovery"]
    B["🧮 Deterministic Tools"] --> F
    C["🔐 Security Governance"] --> F
    D["🔍 Auditability"] --> F
    E["👤 Human Oversight"] --> F
```

---

# 🎯 What Makes SupplyShield Different?

| Conventional AI Workflow | SupplyShield |
|---|---|
| Single general-purpose agent | Specialized multi-agent architecture |
| LLM-generated facts | Deterministic source-of-truth tools |
| Actions may be loosely controlled | Policy-gated execution |
| External instructions may influence behavior | Untrusted inputs remain untrusted |
| Success-oriented responses | Explicit `NO_FEASIBLE_PLAN` state |
| Limited observability | Auditable security and recovery events |
| Static UI | Backend-driven operational control room |
| AI-only decision | AI + deterministic verification + governance |

---

# 🌍 Enterprise Vision

SupplyShield is designed as a foundation for **governed AI-driven operational resilience**.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    A["🌐 Real-World Supply Chain"] --> B["📡 Operational Signals"]

    B --> C["🧠 Multi-Agent Intelligence"]

    C --> D["🧮 Deterministic Verification"]

    F --> G["📋 Recovery Proposal"]

    G --> H["👤 Human Authorization"]

    H --> I["⚙️ Enterprise Execution"]

    I --> J["🔍 Continuous Audit"]

    J -.-> C
```

The long-term objective is not simply to build another AI dashboard.

It is to create a **governed operational intelligence layer** that can sit between real-world supply-chain signals and enterprise decision-making systems.
